 $(basename $0) -- Restores disk image(s) of a virtual machine from saved backups (made with vm-full-backup, vm-inc-backup or virtnbdbackup-auto) up to a selected checkpoint in time.

    USAGE: $(basename $0) [ -h | --help ] [-s | --source <absolute-path>]

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - It can restore a full system (default option), as well as individual disks or drives
    - Without arguments, it works interactively: A series of options and questions are presented before to actually start the process
    - When everything has been set to ptoceed, awaits for confirmation before to start (restoration may take time, depending on the data volume to restore, hadware speed, etc.)
    - Once completed, displays the final result about the operation (full success, partial restoration of disks or fail) showing a summary of restored/failed disks if restoration was partial.

    NOTES:
    - Use it only with backups created from the SAME Virtual Machine you're attempting to restore!
    - If the virtual machine to restore is running, it will be (gracefully) powered OFF right before to start the process
    - When old disk images are kept and restoration was successful, a timestamp with its last modification time is appended to each replaced image fila.
    - The script is NOT aware of remaining space left, so you must be careful when keping too many old images, specially on scenarios with constrains about storage.
